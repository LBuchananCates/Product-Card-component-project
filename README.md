## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

More practice with CSS flexbox in mobile and desktop; my biggest challenge with CSS is remembering how to center the main container as it can determine how its contents will shift in different screen sizes

```css
.product-container {
        display: flex;
        overflow: auto;
    }

.product-container {
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 20px;
    width: 80%;
    margin: 50px auto;
}
```

### Continued development

- Solid skills in CSS, but now with the focus on ultimate efficiency

### Useful resources

- MDN
- stackoverflow
- css-tricks
- w3 schools
