## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Mostly proud of how clearly I labelled the classes in html to make the styling part easier (always a challenge)

```html
<div class="price-title">
        <div class="current-price">$149.99</div>
        <div class="original-price">$169.99</div>
      </div>
```

### Continued development

I wish to continue focusing on finding more flexible ways to size fonts and images instead of using hard-set measurements like px instead of % or rem which allow for easier transition between screen sizes. Throughout the coding process in the CSS file, I found myself going back and trying to fix sizing with pixels then realized percentages and rems are easier to work with and there isn't a massive difference in fonts when changing screen sizes on mobile.
