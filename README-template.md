- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

I wish to continue focusing on finding more flexible ways to size fonts and images instead of using hard-set measurements like px instead of % or rem which allow for easier transition between screen sizes. Throughout the coding process in the CSS file, I found myself going back and trying to fix sizing with pixels then realized percentages and rems are easier to work with and there isn't a massive difference in fonts when changing screen sizes on mobile.
